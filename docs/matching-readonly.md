# EGYM ↔ Garmin matching — read-only (phase 3)

## Initial slice

This branch starts with a pure comparison module, without new login attempts or API writes. It works on already-normalized exercise data and returns explicit comparison outcomes.

- Exercise identity is mapped by EGYM `activity.activityId` to Garmin `(category, exerciseName)`; workout order is not considered.
- Garmin recorded set weight is **assumed to be grams** and converted to kilograms via `/ 1000`, consistent with observed examples. This assumption still requires formal validation before writes.
- All Garmin strength sets for an exercise must share a single non-null recorded weight; conflicting weights are reported as ambiguous.
- Unknown exercises and missing sets are reported explicitly, never guessed.
- `IsActiveStrength` must be supplied by the ingestion layer to exclude REST and INDOOR_BIKE records. No inference from `ACTIVE` alone.
- The current mapping is account-specific and provisional.
- This slice compares only weights. It does **not** decide which Garmin activity belongs to which EGYM workout. That session matching must be implemented and tested separately before combining histories.
- No template modification, activity update, exercise count adjustment, or cardio alteration is performed.

## Next slices

1. Add unit tests and CI for the comparison module.
2. Normalize EGYM and Garmin data from the existing read-only clients.
3. Match workout sessions using timestamps, method and confidence constraints, never just index/position.
4. Produce user-reviewable weight diffs for activity history and templates, keeping every write disabled.
